# Monte-Carlo-Simulation-in-pycharm
This project is a Monte Carlo Simulation written in Python using PyCharm. The simulation generates a set of random points within a square and uses the proportion of points that fall within a quarter circle inscribed in the square to estimate the value of pi.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have PyCharm installed on your computer. You can download PyCharm from the official website here.
Once you have PyCharm installed, you can clone or download the project files from the GitHub repository.

# Brief explanation
The Monte Carlo simulation project is a Python program written using PyCharm, a popular Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The program simulates the movement of a particle in a two-dimensional space using a random walk algorithm. The user can specify the number of steps the particle takes, the length of each step, and the initial position of the particle.
The program uses the math and random modules of Python to perform calculations and generate random numbers. It also uses the matplotlib module to visualize the movement of the particle.
When the program is executed, it generates a plot that shows the path of the particle as it moves through the two-dimensional space. The plot also displays the final position of the particle and the distance it has traveled.
The Monte Carlo simulation project is a useful tool for analyzing and understanding the behavior of particles in a variety of contexts, including physics, chemistry, and engineering. It can be used to model the movement of atoms, molecules, and other particles in a wide range of applications, from drug design to materials science to environmental modeling.
Overall, this project demonstrates the power and flexibility of Monte Carlo simulation as a tool for modeling complex systems and phenomena in the natural world.

# Running the Simulation
To run the simulation, simply open the project files in PyCharm and run the monte_carlo.py file. The simulation will prompt you to enter the number of points to generate for the simulation.
After the simulation runs, you will see the estimated value of pi printed to the console.

# Simulation Results
The simulation generates a set of random points within a square and uses the proportion of points that fall within a quarter circle inscribed in the square to estimate the value of pi. The more points generated, the more accurate the estimate of pi will be.
You can experiment with different numbers of points to see how the accuracy of the estimate changes. Additionally, you can modify the size of the square and the quarter circle to see how that affects the estimate of pi.
